   - **Community Forum:** A space for students to connect and share experiences.
   - **Contact Page:** Information on how to reach support staff or AI assistance.

2. **AI Integration:**
   - **Chatbot:** An AI-driven chatbot to provide instant support and answer common questions related to academic pressure, time management, and mental health.
   - **Personalized Recommendations:** AI algorithms to suggest resources based on user input regarding their specific challenges.

- JavaScript files for AI functionalities (chatbot, scheduling assistant).
- Backend files for user account management and data storage.

## Followup Steps:
1. Set up a development environment (e.g., using a framework like React or Angular).
2. Begin coding the website based on the outlined structure.
3. Integrate AI functionalities using appropriate libraries or APIs (e.g., Dialogflow for the chatbot).
4. Test the website for usability and functionality.
5. Launch the website and promote it to university students.
